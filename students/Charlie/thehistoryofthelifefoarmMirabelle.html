    <p> For centries, sientists have been reaserching the amazing life form best known as Mirabelle. Shoestealer, Bananaeater, and Purple frog are other scientific names used to describe this unusual creature. This rare species is located on the top of mount Palo Alto. Their population has dropped drastically in the past 5 years, starting from 2016-and ending in 2020, with the lowest population of 1, due to the wild Noor, The Mirabells' most dangerous predator. Lucy Irvine, a sientist researching in Astrobiology, discovered the Mirabelle in 2009.<p>

            </p>
            <p>After graduating with a PHD in Quantitative Biosciences, Lucy traveled to the Bay area to continue her research. "I knew a discovery was coming, but I knever knew it would be somthing as strange as the Mirabelle." Lucy never intended on discovering a new species. The Mirabelle was named for her protective noises, that sound almost identical with a bell.   </p>

            <p> Sadly, while reaserchers have more to discover on this myseriouse creature, the Mirabelle is now extinct. In 2021, The Wild Noor made her move, after years of planning. With a sharp poke to the right arm, the Wild Noor managed to END the Mirabelle. Today, we honor Mirabelle, and all that she has done for our planet. There is evan a statue built in her honor, located in the east wing of the Infinity Auto Salvage, a junk yard located in East Palo Alto. </p>

            <p>"I visited that junk yard the day the statue was built. I felt honored!" Jade Palatnik, a sientist studing at Stanford said one afternoon. While the Mirabelle had many fans, she had some haters too, "I am kinda glad she went extinct!" Jane Rukavina stated not long after. </p>
