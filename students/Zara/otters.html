<h1> Sea Otters</h1>
<p> Sea otters are the adorable, furry marine animals often seen floating
    on their back in the ocean. They are native to the northern and eastern 
    coasts of The North Pacific Ocean. Adults typically weigh between 14 to 45 kg.
    While this makes them small among marine animals, they are actually
    the heaviest member of the weasel family. When they sleep, they often hold hands
    to prevent from floating away. </p><div><img width=400 src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/scaled/2013/09/16/article-2421731-1BD4E76C000005DC-569_636x382.jpg"/><div/><p/>
<h2>Baby Sea Otters</h2>
    </div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl6zZEHBHwE">Newborns</a> fur traps so much air, 
        that they can't dive under water, so they often float and lay on their
        mothers since they can't swim. 
    When their mothers leave for hunting, they rap their pups in kelp.They are born 
    with their eyes open, teeth already amerging.</p>
