        <h2>Meet the Family! (Non-GMS Peoples)</h2> 
        <h3>Tomothy (Tom) Lansux</h3>
        <p>Tom is Carina's ex-husband, they met at Taco-Bell beach and had an extremely quick courtship (like 5 minutes) before becoming engaged (which lasted a day) and eventually married, sadly, the marriage did not work out because Tom was too obsessed with his fire trucks. According to Amelia S., "Tom is a 2 foot tall, 15 year old boy who has arms that are yea long and legs that are yea tall, he's got the curliest brown hair and the most pinchable face." Tom and Carina have 1 daughter, Vivi H. Lanasux together.  </p>
        <h3>Timothy (Tim) Lanasux</h3>
        <p>Tim is Tom's younger brother, according to Amelia S., he is a 1.5 foot tall boy who also has arms that are yea long and legs that are yea tall. Tim was introduced to Lana by Amelia and the also had an extremely quick courtship. Sadly though, Tim and Lana's marriage ended when Lana brutally murdered her husband. no biggie. happens every day.</p>
        <h3>Baby Fat Panda</h3>
        <p>Baby Fat Panda is Fat Panda (Carina's) child. Who knows who their father is. I mean you'd think that it'd be a panda right? But NOPEEE...it's a weird human blob.  </p>
        <h3>Luke Skywalker</h3>
        <p>I'm guessing most of you know who Luke is, but if you don't, he's the one waving around the GIANT glowstick in Star Wars. Luke is a very loved yet hated by Charlie, his somewhat beloved wife, I say this because they're divorced and remarried practically every hour. Luke has been murdered many, many times, mostly by his Mother-in-Law, Jane, who has constantly voiced disapproval. Luckily though, he has been taped back together multiple times by Judy. Luke and Charlie have 1 daughter together, Laila, who was somehow magically born on a spcaeship in another galaxy. I guess that means Laila inherited the force? is that how it works? someone let me know.</p>
        <h3>Tammy and Tammy 2.0</h3>
        <p>Tammy is a tampon. She was murdered. Tammy 2.0 is a tampon. She is missing. Is there really hope?</p>
        <h3>Bobby-Timmy and Bobby-Timmy 2.0</h3>
        <p>Bobby-Timmy is a pad. He was murdered. Bobby-Timmy 2.0 is a pad. He is missing. Wow...this says something about Carina's parenting skills. </p>
        <h3>Amelio Judth</h3>
        <p>Amelio Judth is Jane's precious baby. He was given birth on 10/5 during Physical Edumacation. He is a volleyball. Jane somehow gave birth to a volleyball. Fully inflated. Kudos to Frances for being great emotional support. Amelio grew up too fast....or maybe Jane abondoned him so he learned how to survive himself. Either way, Amelio is now living a life as a normal volleyball with his volleyball friends.</p>
        <h3>Bad Boy Jonas</h3>
        <p>Bad Boy Jonas is a Bad Boy.</p>
        <h3>Swedish Dream Seaweed Hand Cream</h3>
