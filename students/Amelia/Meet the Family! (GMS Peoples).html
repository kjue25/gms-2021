        <h2>Meet the Family! (GMS Peoples)</h2> 
        <h3>Amelia</h3>
        <p>I like to think of myself as the pillar of this family.</p>
        <img src="carina.png">
        <h3>Carina</h3>
        <p>I'm amazing but stupidly Jane's ugly niece and I like goldfish. Lana killed my husband but not before we had a whole lot of kids.</p>
        <h3>Lucy</h3>
        <p>The perfect daughter of Amelia and Jane and I have a good conscience.</p>
        <h3>Caperton</h3>
        <p>I was adopted and then disowned by Alaina after I screamed in her ear. I got married to Zara but I am now divorced, I am married to her sister, Lucy now...not the good child anymore huh?</p>
        <h3>Charlie</h3>
        <p>I guess you could say me and Luke have an on and off relationship.</p>
        <h3>Lana</h3>
        <p>Murdering people is fun.</p>
        <h3>Mirabelle</h3>
        <p>Amelia is my Mother, Jane is my Other Mother and I got my cheese genes from Amelia's brother. I have 5 kids, Quinn, Bee, Ari, Grace and Andrea C. and I'm trying to adopt Robin.</p>
        <h3>Kali</h3>
        <p>I'm Lana's ex but then she murdered me...maybe? I was reincarcerated as Carina's daughter. I love my ex-grandfather, Draco.</p>
        <h3>Lauren R.</h3>
        <p>I'm technically related to everyone in this family throught Jane. I'm married to Vivi...she's a charity case.</p>
        <h3>Zara</h3>
        <p>Amelia is my Mother and Jane is my Other Mother. I was married to Caperton but we got divorced. I was murdered by Lana but brought back to life by myself.</p>
        <h3>Judy</h3>
        <p>My full name is Dr. Judth A. Mykale and I've been Amelia and Jane's cousin, great niece and now granddaughter, I am my uncles Godmother and I am Lucy and Caperton's adopted prodigy child.</p>
        <h3>Vivi</h3>
        <p>I'm Carina's daughter, was my Great-Aunt, Jane's, mistress and am now her sister Lauren's wife.</p>
        <h3>Jane</h3>
        <p>Why do my kids keep having kids?</p>
        <h3>Sophia</h3>
        <p>So this family is extremely wack. My sister is married to my ex (fictional) husband and I am in love with a fictional character. Who am I related to?</p>
        <h3>Shira</h3>
        <p>I'm an OG but nobody remembers me cuz I'm useless :(.</p>
        <h3>Katie</h3>
        <p> I know I'm Zara and El's daughter, Carina too. Being adopted was not my decision, I was dragged into it.</p>
        <h3>Izzy</h3>
        <p>I'm the forgotten child who has been passed around between mothers</p>
        <h3>Liana</h3>
        <p>Forgotten child #1.</p>
        <h3>Noor</h3>
        <p>Forgotten child #2.</p>
        <h3>Elaine</h3>
        <p>Carina adopted me, Baby Fat Panda is my brother and Lanasux is my last name.</p>
        <h3>Rebecca</h3>
        <p>I hate this family because it's loud. I love this family because I am now related to Vivi and I'm neutral cause I really don't care.</p>
        <h3>Alaina</h3>
        <p>I'm THE OG, apparently, half of my kids are married to fictional characters, a fourth of them are married to muderered people and 1/4 of them are failure children.</p>
        <h3>Laila</h3>
        <p>Amelia, Jane, Charlie = Family.</p>
