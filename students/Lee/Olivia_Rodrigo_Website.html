    <br>
    <br>
    "hi there! I’m 18 years old and writing songs is my favorite thing to do in the world. I’ve been doing it for as long as I can remember and I fall more in love with it every day. The first song I ever got published was called “All I Want.” I wrote it for a show I act in and it was a super cool experience that opened up a lot of doors for me. I spent most of quarantine writing songs in my living room and producing them in a garage, including drivers license."
