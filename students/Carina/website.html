<h3>The week before school ended 
    (or a couple weeks), Andi threw a puberty party, 
    with red velvet cupcakes and juiceboxes. A few crazy people put tampons and pads on
    their face, and GMS posted a photo of it on instagram.

<h3>Bobby Timmy and Tammy. Bobby Timmy the 1st got ripped apart by Dana, and Tammy the 1st got lost. So 
    Jane got new ones from the bathroom, and Bobby Timmy and Tammy the 2nd were born. </h3>
