        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p> We are an after school art program, Artfer School, that teaches kids all of the art techniques. With only five kids per class and top of the line teachers, we create the right space for children to find themselves as artists. K-12 classes help students conntinue our program throughout their childhood.</p>
