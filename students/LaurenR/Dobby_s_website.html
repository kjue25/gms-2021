            <h3>
                Name
            </h3>
            <p>
                When I was born, I have a little white sock on my paw, so my owners decided to name me Dobby, after the house elf from Harry Potter, one of our favortie movies. 
                I like to bark at Hagrid.

                Breed
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a Portuguese Water Dog, who were used to help fisherman drag nets in Portugal!
                I am black with little white hairs here and there. I am swirly coat, which is a mix between a curly and a wavey.

            <h3>
                Activities
            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a very active dog, and live to swim and go on walks. I get one or two a day. My favorite toys are my squeaky 
                pig and my lobster, Larry Seinor (RIP LARRY JUNIOR), which I can swing it around with its multiple claws and things.
                I sometimes get to go fun places like the beach, where I eat the sand, but don't go in thw water. The waves scare me.
