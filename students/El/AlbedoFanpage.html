        <h1>Albedo</h1>
        <p> Albedo is a 5 star character in the game Genshin Impact.</p>
        <img width=1000 src="Genshin-Impact-Albedo.jpg"/>  
        <p>He was released back in December and has not gotten a rerun yet.
            Most other 5 star characters that were released between the launch of the game and March have gotten reruns
        </p>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>There is not much known about Albedo's backsory, as he is very myterious.
            What we do know is that he is not from Mondstadt which is the region we meet him in.  
            Many people theorise that he was created with alchemy. Though this is not comfirmed, there is lots of evidence to back it up.
            (Ignore my last sentence it was confrimed. He's not human. He's also related to the poisonous dragon Durin, who died on the snowy mountain known as Dragonspine.)

        <h2>His smug face</h2>
        <p>Yes this is getting its own section</p>
        <img src="smug-albedo.jpg"/>
        <p>His smug face is everything. That is all. Also this gif is everything
        </p>

        <h2>His Hair in game vs his hair in official art</h2>
        <p>Albedo's hair in official art is very fluffy, whereas in game his hair is very flat.</p>
        <img width=500 src="albedo.png"/>
        <p>See? fluffy hair. In game, his hair isn't as fluffy, as you can see in the image shwing his smug face</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3U51KyZLxE"><h3>Character Demo</h3></a>
        <p>The visuals in his character demo are so cool. His theme music is also very vibey.
            I love everything about this.
