<h1>Caperton's Cats</h1>
<h2>Grayson's story</h2>
<p>Me and my mom were going on a walk when my mom got a call from her docter so we stopped walking.
 I starrted to look around and I saw this cute kitten. (I was already fostering and rescueing kittens.) 
 I saw her and she was playing with a tricicle sticking her head inside the wheels.

        It took me a second but I caught her and ran to my house, up the stairs and into my parents room. 
        I showed my dad and his exacte words were: "Are you kidding me."I have raised Grayson from that day on. 
        She is now one and is so pretty.</Ar></tr>

<h2>Bear & Freedom's Story</h2>
<p>   Bear and Freedom are brothers. During quarantine I want to get new fosters so I asked my mom's friend who was kind of 
    my mentor. She said that she has some kittens that we can foster. So I was so excited. One night me and my mom got in
    the car. We drove to this pet store. We waited for my mom's friend. Then there she was with 3 kittens in her carrier.
    We took them and said thank you.

<p>   When in the car I checked what the cats genders were they had told us that the gray on was a boy and so was the mixed
     colors one and that the black one was a girl. They got it wrong the black one was a boy, the gray one was a girl and the 
    mixed one they got right he was a boy. I named the black one Bear for his offical name it was different at the begining.
    I named the mixed one Freedom in the end and he had several names as well. I then named the gray one Hope and she had a 
    couple names at the begining. Hope is now adopted and her new name is Amera. Bear and Freedom are still with me and are 
    going to stay with me. </p>

    <h2>Honor my cats</h2>
<p>    I honor my cats by playing, feeding, cleaning litter boxs, and loving them. I love my cats so much. I will always 
    protect them because I am there mother. I will care and love them forever. It's like my mom says to me "Love you to the 
    moon and back fiercly and forever. If you want to learn how to care for you feline friend then  go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HMx18-4do">here.</a></p>
