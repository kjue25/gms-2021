<h1>All About Stranger Things</h1>
<H5>By: Lana Weshahy
<H4> Stranger Things is a suspensful, and thrilling show. It currently has 3 seasons but the 4th is being released sometime next year in 2021. I recomend watching stranger things (you can easily find it on netflix) if you enjoy watching a suspensful and scary show.</H4>
<H5>WARNING: If you get nightmares very easily I do not recomend watching Stranger Things</H5>
