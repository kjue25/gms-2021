            The Fell Pony breed, native to Great Britain, is suitable for any discipline. Fell ponies are strong enough to hold an adult, but not to large to carry a child, at usually 13hh (hh, hands, is a measurement type for horses). It's quick walk is comfortable, and they can easily manuever rough terrain- they're very agile and quick on their feet.

            Fell Ponies get their names from the treeless hills where the breed orginated. Hundreds of years ago, they were used to haul carts and plows. They were also, sometimes, used as pack animals to transport goods across rough terrain.
