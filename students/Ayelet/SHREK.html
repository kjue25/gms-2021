<h2>The story of Shrek</h2>
<p>When a green ogre named Shrek discovers his swamp has been 'swamped' with all sorts of fairytale creatures by the powerful Lord Farquaad, Shrek sets out with a very loud donkey by his side to 'persuade' Farquaad to give Shrek his swamp back. Instead, a deal is made. Farquaad, who wants to become the King, sends Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona, who is awaiting her true love in a tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. But once they head back to Farquaad with Fiona, it starts to become apparent that Shrek, a green smelly ogre, is falling in love with the lovely princess Fiona, but is Fiona really an ordinary 'lovely' princess? Who will Fiona end up with?</p>
