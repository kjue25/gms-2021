    <h1>Lord Farquaad</h1>
    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>In his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his kingdom of Fairy Tale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture. But because Farquaad is not of royal blood, he cannot become a king until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona can be his perfect wife and queen, but she first must be rescued from her tower, which is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.

        Unwilling to perform the rescue himself, Farquaad holds a tournament to discover the knight who will rescue Fiona. Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc during the tournament attempting to force Farquaad to remove the Fairy Tale creatures from his swamp. They defeat the knights, so Farquaad decides to send Shrek on the quest. Farquaad agrees to move the Fairy Tale creatures out of Shrek's swamp and grant him the deed to the swamp to prevent any future squatters if Shrek rescues Fiona. Shrek delivers Fiona to Farquaad, who immediately proposes, unaware that she becomes an ogress at sunset. Shrek later disrupts the marriage ceremony, delaying a kiss between Farquaad and Fiona until after sunset.
        
        Fiona makes the transition from human to ogress form, upon which Farquaad rejects his new bride, banishing her back to the tower and claiming the title of King. He also sentences Shrek to death. Before Farquaad finishes his claim of becoming the new King, the dragon who had guarded Fiona, and who developed a crush on Donkey while Fiona was being rescued, crashes through the window in response to Shrek's beckoning whistle. She devours Farquaad and burps out his crown. Farquaad was apparently not well-liked in Duloc; when he is eaten, the citizens laugh and cheer.</p>
