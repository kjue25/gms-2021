    <h5>although red and white blood cells are both 
        found in the human body, they both have
         different functions.the red blood cell is 
         in charge of carrying blood and spreading it
          throughout the body. They can also be found 
          in bone marrowsand because of them bones stay 
          alive.    </h5>
