<h2> Records and Accomplishments.</h2>
<p> BTS have broken many records and conquered tons of accomplishments. From being the first Kpop artist to be nominated for a grammy to the first Artist ever to get #1 for four different songs on the Hot Billboard 100. They started out with BIGHIT which was on the verge of bankruptcy, they all slept in the same room with three bunkbeds and one twin sized bed. they had scarce meals and had to sell their tickets in the streets in person. But slowly their fame began to grow. As their band leader said "Bang Si-Hyuk once said that we would be the biggest boy band in the world and we just laughed at him" (Bang Si-Hyuk is their CEO). Their fame grew along with the number of armies currently there are more than 40.8 billion.</p>
