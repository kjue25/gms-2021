<p> This is Teddy!He is a 1 almost 2 year old Maltipoo! Teddy was born November 19 2020, he was 2 months old when we got him! 
    He was sooo tiny! When we got him, we started to notice that he was not eating
    and we were scared because he was so tiny and we didnt want anything to happen to him.
    We took him to the vet and they said that he was not eating because he had low blood pressure
    and he was using to much of his energy. So they injected pedialyte into him. It was pretty strange
     but he was all good after 1hr!</p>

     <p> This is Roxie! She is a 10 month Maltipoo! Her birthday is December 17, so we will be celebrating
         her 1st birthday soon! She LOVES all kinds of toys! She bring a specific toy ball everywhere
         she goes! We got her in Febuary and she got more attatched to me so she's basically
         my child. When we got her we noticed a small ball in her stomach area, we didnt know 
         what it was untill we went to the vet and they told us it was a hurnea! We were a bit 
         scared but after a few more visits we learned that it wasnt a super dangerous one which was 
         great news :) <p>/
