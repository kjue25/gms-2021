<H3> Hamster Care </H3>

<h4> Bad Hamster care </h4>

<p> Hamsters are small but need big cages. Most petstores will advise you with small cruel hamster cage that is not an appropriate 
    sized cage, as well as give you an unhealthy food diet that is not balenced with all the nutrition that hamsters needs.
    Hamsters are also often given a very small wheel that will curve their backs (like the picture at the bottom) This is really bad and 
    is not healthy for you hasmter, hamsters have really fragile backs, mesh hamster wheels are also not a good option as it will hurt 
    the hamsters paw/feet and this will cause an infection. Hamsters are burrorowers so this means they need bedding, idealy paper based UNCENTED bedding,
    most petstores will have cented bedding and this is not ideal for the respitory system. Hamsters are SOLITARY animals an should not be risked do to 
    fighting and death.

<p>
Hamsters need a big appropiet sized cage (minimum 450 sq in) an inexpensive option for a cage is a DIY bin cage this way you can provide a big spacies cage for 
your hamster, the bigger the hamster cage the less you need to clean it. Hamsters are natural burrorowers so they need idealy 6 inch of bedding but more is better
as they make under ground tunnels. Hamsters need lots of inritchment a hamster wheel and bedding is not going to put it.
Hamsters are also cheweres so they need lots od chew toys to grinned their teeth, as they continuously keep growing. Hamsters love to hide so little houses are great for your hamster to hide in whenever they feel threatend.
