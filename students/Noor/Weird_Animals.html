    <p>Prepare to be amazed, weirded out, and/or start to question your existence with a list of the top 10 weirdest and craziest animals.</p> 
    <h3>Number 1: Blobfish</h3>
    <img width= 1000 src="Blobfish.png"/>
    <p>The blobfish is a deep sea fish found in the depths of the waters in New Zealand/Australia. It does not look like the picture when it is in the water, but when it is dragged up to the surface the trauma makes it collapse into a blob. </p>
    <h5>EW rating: 7/10</h5>
    <h3>Number two: Snails</h3>
    <img width=1000 src="Snail.png"/>
    <p>Everyone has seen a snail before. I mean, if you haven't, what have you been doing? Living under a rock your whole life? But wait, you still would've seen a snail because they like living under rocks... anyway, back to the topic. Snails are weird because they are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs. When a snail meets another snail and they are both at the age to mate, they will battle to see who gets to be the father. Being a mother means carrying/laying eggs, looking after the baby snails for a little while, and it is much harder work than the father snail, who just gets to do his job in the mating system and get on with life. I don't know how to feel about how snails reproduce, honestly.</p>
    <h5>EW rating: 6/10</h5>
    <h3>Number 3: Handfish</h3>
    <img width=1000 src="Handfish.png"/>
    <p>The handfish is an endangered type of fish. Instead of swimming, it "walks" using its "hands."" Just imagine walking on your hands all day long! #FishCanBeGymnastsToo. These are pretty cool fish!</p>
    <h5>EW rating: 4/10 </h5>
    <h3>Number 4: Tardigrade</h3>
    <img width= 1000 src="WaterBear.png"/>
    <p>These near miscroscopic creatues, commonly called tardigrades, water bears, or moss piglets, are really weird because they can survive almost anything. I'm telling you, it's true! They can live in outer space, all the way to the depths of the seas. This is possible because they can expel most of the water from their bodies, and curl up into a dehydrated ball called a tun. They can survive for hundreds of year while in this state. They can also be revived from the state. One sceintist found a tardigrade that had been in a tun for 120 years+, and revived it! It is mind blowing.</p>
    <h5>EW rating: 4/10</h5>
    <h3>Number 5: Amphiuma</h3>
    <img width= 1000 src="Amphiuma.png"/>
    <p>Amphiumas are marine creatures that are native to the Southeastern United States. They look a lot like eels, but they are actually salamanders. They live in swamps, mostly. Not much is known about them, since they are rare and blend into their habitats very nicely.</p>
    <h5>EW rating: 7/10</h5>
    <h3>Number 6: Giant Desert Centipede</h3>
    <img width=1000 src="GiantDesertCentipede.png"/>
    <p>EW EW EW OK. This is a Giant Desert Centipede, and it is DISGUSTING! it typically grows to become 6-8 inches long, but has been known to become 9 inches in some cases! These POISONOUS arthropods inject venom into its prey to kill/dissolve it, and can also use its sharp pincers to dismember prey. They eat lizards, frogs, rodents, and insects. </p>
    <h5>EW rating: 10/10 MY BUG PHOBIA IS ACTING UP</h5>
    <h3>Number 7: Cuttlefish</h3>
    <img width=1000 src="Cuttlefish.png"/>
    <p>Cuttlefish are marine mollusks closely realted to squid and octopuses. They can change color rapidly, and are referred to as "the chamelons of the sea" sometimes. They can squirt ink, just like octopuses and squids, and have a huge brain-to-body ratio, meaning they are very smart. I think they are pretty cute, actually!</p>
    <h5>EW rating: 2/10</h5>
    <h3>Number 8: Velvet worms</h3>
    <img width=1000 src="VelvetWorm.png"/>
    <p>The Velvet worm is a carnivorous worm that lives in humid climates such as rainforests. They have a very unusual way of catching prey. They have two jets just behind their heads, and once they locate their prey, they shoot out some sticky slime which acts kind of like glue, drying quickly and trapping the prey in place. They then suck up the innards of their prey. Insect organ stew for dinner! </p>
    <h5>EW rating: 9/10 (looks a little cute but is still pretty disgusting)</h5>
    <h3>Number 9: Immortal Jellyfish</h3>
    <img width=1000 src="ImmortalJellyfish.png"/>
    <p>The Immortal Jellyfish is exactly what the name sounds like- they can live forever. Every time an Immortal Jellyfish gets damaged or frigtened, they can turn into a polyp (baby) very quickly. They can also do this when they get very old. So essentially, these jellies could live FOREVER if they wanted to. </p>
    <h5>EW rating: 4/10</h5>
    <h3>And finally, Number 10: Comb Jellies!</h3>
    <img width=1000 src="CombJelly.png"/>
    <p>Comb Jellies are marine creatures made of 95% water. They are bioluminescent, and that is why their comb plates glow! They do not have most organs, and just let oxygen and nutrients pass through them. They can be cannibals, and bite off chunks of other comb jellies they come across! These guys are also hermaphrodites (refer to number two: snails). </p>
