   <p>these little cuddly balls of fur are newborn calico cats. did you know that baby calico cats have 2 X chromosomes (one thats orange/yellow and the other being brown/black).</p> 
   <p>these 2 chromosomes will at some point activate during the development of the embryo, giving the unique color pattern that calico cats show off.</p>
