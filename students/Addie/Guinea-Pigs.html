Story of how I got my guinea pigs:</p>
   <p> I really wanted new pets during COVID so early december 2020 I asked my mom is I could get a small, little, rodent and she suprisly said yes. The next day we called
    many differnt petcos but because of Thanksgiving just ending their weekly suply of guinea pigs was behind. The next wednesday, when the new guinea pigs were supose 
    to come, we called and they said that they needed to clean them up so they'ed be ready at noon. They also said that they would get six guinea pigs and only ending 
    up getting four. My mom, dad and I got to petco before noon and one was already gone! I wanted two girls because, you cant have oppisite genders if you don't want
    baby guinea pigs, so there was one scrawny looking girl which colors were white, gray, and black. There was another girl who was hiding in a hidee which I couldn't 
    really see besides her brown snount. Then, there was the cutest little boy who was black, white, and blonde. He looked adorbue by kind-of shy. So of corse, we got 
    him. My mom was calling another petco to make sure they had guinea pigs while my dad drove us there because guinea pigs can acully die of lonyness if they don't 
    have another guinea pig friend in their cage. We get there and there are two boys and two girls. There is anothe cople there looking at one of the buys so we get
    the other one. In the car ride home my family and I tossed out names but the ones that stuck were: for the first one is Buttercup, Butter and for the second one 
    Bubuganush, Bubu.
