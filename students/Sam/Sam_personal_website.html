    <h1>The School Education System</h1>
<p> The School System has undoubtably many potholes, and many victories.
     These victories and potholes shapes furture and current generations and will, 
    for the foreseeable future, continue to do so. Some of these potholes do include pronoun and gender, 
    to a fault it's society's lack of adjustment. But, 
     undoubtably there are adjustments that the school system should accomidate
      to. Seeing as modern day effects depend on raising the 'future generations'. </p>


  <p> Most faults are centered on the students, my peers, comfortibility within the
     school grounds. Bathrooms, peer acceptance, correct pronouns and names, and
      teacher acceptance. Many kids don't come out in fear of not being accepted 
    and to be disrespected. In some situations they need protection from other students
and sometimes teachers. From unfair treatment, ridicule, and many other forms of 
unwanted attention.
</p>
<h3> Bathrooms</h3>
<p> Bathrooms are eaisily one of the top problems on LGBT students promblems. 
    From people who don't identify with objectively 'Male' or 'Female'. Or, 
    not feeling enough validation to be able to go into the restroom they identify 
    with. In either case restrooms are a problem that should be argued about to 
    extend to gender expansive students, and furthering gender expansive adults.
</p>
<p>
    Gender expansive or Nonbinary bathrooms would be an easy solution. Although currently 
    unable to assist with dysforia and feelings of invalidation. Sanitary products in both 
    bathrooms and non-gendered signs.
</p>
<h3>Prefered Names and Pronouns</h3>
<p>
    Neo-prouns, non-binary, dead names, chosen names. There's a lot of work time 
    thought put into a person coming out and transitioning. But, theres process of 
    school forms in which their dead name is already regestered. Furthereing the
    switch is hard to come out to towards their teachers. Names aren't file within 
    the school and documents have a set list. The School System as a whole should 
    become moreover flexible to these changes.
</p>
<h3>Moreover and Overall</h3>
<p>
We've continuously argued and debated over rights, as people who don't identify as such.
The School System's Ecucational part can stem to better outcomes and help to these rights.
Futhermore we need to educate and extend for the people around us, factering the suicide 
estmated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_among_LGBT_youth#:~:text=The%20Suicide%20Prevention%20Resource%20Center,times%20higher%20than%20heterosexual%20youth.">to 5 to 10% for LGBT teens.</a>
