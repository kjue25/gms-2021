<p> Every living thing grows and develops. For an exampple we can use cats. As you saw in the photos above, the first photo
    is a kitten and the second photo is a cat.Theese are the same animals just one is fully grown and the other is not. 
Everything grows and develops at different speed. For a kitten it takes 12 months to become a fully grown cat. But humans take 
about 18-25 years to fully devlop. In some organisms, growing involves drastic transformation. For example, just think of how much a think of how much a butterfly grows and devlops. It starts as a egg. Then it transforms into a caterpillar, then into a pupa (chrysalis), and then pops out as a beautiful butterfly.Everything grows at it's own pace. </p>
